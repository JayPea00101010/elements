		<description>
			<p>Ohr Kaluun was an ancient kingdom in Sarlona, ruled by mage-lords renowned for their dark magic and infernal pacts. Ohr Kaluun was laid low centuries ago by those who feared its dark practices, but a few of its noble lines escaped this purge. These refugees fled across the sea and established a new stronghold on the western edge of Droaam. This city, the Venomous Demesne, is a place of arcane wonders, with cruel and alien traditions.</p>
			<p class="indent">The noble houses of the Venomous Demesne are tiefling families, shaped by ancient bargains. Kaluun tieflings possess unnatural charm and intellect, and wield powers of fire and darkness at will. Such tieflings use the Ability Score Increase, Hellish Resistance, and Infernal Legacy traits in the Player’s Handbook.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Malevolent forces permeate the Demon Wastes. Tieflings are sometimes born to the Carrion Tribes that live in the Wastes; such children are called sakah, or “touched” in the Abyssal language. Considered a blessing among the Carrion, many sakah rise to become leaders and champions of their tribes.</p>
			<p class="indent">While Sakah tieflings vary in their appearance and abilities, the rakshasa are dominant fiends of Eberron. Some sakah tieflings reflect this with feline features, tiger-striped fur, or the backwards grip of the rakshasa. Their supernatural gifts likewise resemble those of the tricky rakshasa.</p>

			<p>The Realm of the Dead is a place of misery and despair. Tieflings touched by its power have grey skin and eyes. They don’t have horns, but tendrils of ectoplasmic mist often trail from their bodies. Dolurrhi tieflings hear the whispers of the dead, though often they are too faint to be understood. Many go mad, but others become remarkable mediums, devoted to helping restless spirits find peace.</p>
