		<description>
			<p>You were born a Sahuagin in the Eternal Dominion of the Thunder Sea, but ritual magic and the blood of the kar’lassa allowed you to consume and replace a surface dweller. You can never regain your original form; for all intents and purposes, you are who you appear to be. You’re physically indistinguishable from them, and you have enough of their memories to fool even their family and friends. But you have the mind of a Sahuagin, and you’re loyal to the Dominion. </p>
			<p class="indent">As a malenti, the first question is why the Dominion chose to replace this particular person, and how your mission relates to your activities as an adventurer. It’s possible that your only mission is to observe the dryskins and occasionally provide information to a Sahuagin spymaster, or you might have a specific goal that drives your actions during your adventures. The Suggested Characteristics tables provide information about your mission. </p>
			<p class="indent">You’re physically identical to the creature you appear to be; you are an elf, or a kalashtar, or whatever race you replaced. It is up to you and your DM to decide how widespread malenti are in Khorvaire. It could be that the Dominion has placed many malenti in the Five Nations, or you might be one of the first. If this is the case, you may be the first malenti to duplicate a creature of this particular race or species. This could be particularly interesting with a kalashtar—you’ve inherited the spiritual bond with a quori, but what does that mean for you? Will the tie to the alien spirit change you? Similarly, if you possess a dragonmark, it seems to function normally, but will there be strange consequences in your future?</p>
			<p class="indent">It’s possible that your abilities reflect additional Dominion magebreeding or skills from your Sahuagin side. If you’re a barbarian, does your rage reflect the blood frenzy of the Sahuagin? If you’re a sorcerer, is spellcasting a gift your victim already possessed, or is it the result of Sahuagin modification? And how has the integration of the new personality affected you? Are you still a true Sahuagin, devoted to the Dominion? Or are the victim’s memories and experiences causing you to question your mission?</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Deception, Insight</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Thieves’ tools, poisoner’s kit, or forgery kit</li>
				<li><strong>Languages</strong> Sahuagin</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A seashell, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a purse containing 30 gp, which can be used on equipment needed to match your victim’s identity</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>TOUR OF DUTY</h5>
			<p>As a malenti, you’ve stolen the identity of a surface dweller. But when did this occur? How long have you been playing this role, and how comfortable are you with it?</p>
			<table>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Malenti are deep cover spies. Becoming a malenti means sacrificing the Sahuagin world you’ve known your whole life; it requires strong will and devotion. But malenti are a blend of Sahuagin spy and the person they appear to be; they still have the memories and the mannerisms of the victim, and this can cause the Sahuagin personality to erode or evolve.</p>

		<description>
			<p>As a malenti, you’ve assumed the identity and memories of a dryskin, and this provides you with the benefits of their position. Choose one of the following background features: By Popular Demand (entertainer), Criminal Contact (criminal), Military Rank (soldier), Position of Privilege (noble), or Shelter of the Faithful (acolyte). Once made, you cannot change this choice. This is who you are now, and the background feature suggests what people will expect of you. If you have Shelter of the Faithful, it’s because you’ve taken the place of an acolyte, and people of your assumed faith expect you to live up to that role.</p>
