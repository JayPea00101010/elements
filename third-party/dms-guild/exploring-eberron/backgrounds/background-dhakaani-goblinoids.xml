			<p>Over the last few decades, the Khesh’dar have established safe houses and agents in many of the major cities of Khorvaire. In addition, many modern goblins are keen to hear tales of ancient Dhakaan and are happy to trade a meal for a story or song. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate in any sizable community of goblins. They’ll shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they won’t risk their lives for you.</p>

			<p>You have an especially strong connection to the Uul Dhakaan, the dream of the Dhakaani Empire. You are more likely than most to remember your dreams, and you may have a mentor who offers you guidance; this could be the memory of an ancestor or fallen hero, or a living uul’kala bard. Whenever you take a long rest, there’s a chance you’ll receive a vision, a mission, or a clue about your current situation.</p>
